## Problem statement 

The Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS) encourages wildfire mitigation through the Forest Restoration & Wildfire Risk Mitigation (FRWRM) Grant Program.  The legislation authorizing funding for the program seeks to encourage funding to areas with “fewer economic resources”.  The CSFS needs to define “fewer economic resources”, and provide this information to applicants, preferably through the existing Colorado Forest Atlas.

Defining what constitutes "fewer economic resources"is not straight forward.  In this work we will draw from the literature regarding what non-landscape related risk factors make individuals more vulnerable to natural disasters such as fire.  We will then adapt the general factors to be specific to the characteristics of the WUI within Colorado and Fire context.  

## Introduction to Social Vulnerability, a broad definition of "fewer economic resources"

Forest fires in the western United States are growing in frequency and intensity. As this continues to occur fire suppression costs also rise.  The federal government's average budget for 2015-2019 was 159% of the previous 5-year average(National Interagency Fire Center).  The cost of suppression is only a small part of the full cost, however, as many individuals lost property, suffered injury, and experienced poor health as a result of the fire and its smoke. Mitigation is an important tool for decreasing the overall effect of wildfire on communities and on federal budgets.  

Mitigation efforts fall into two categories, landscape mitigation and community mitigation.  The FRWRM grant program focuses on the latter.  A large number of communtiy mitigation projects are focused solely on physical risk factors, but we know from the literature that social factors such as poverty, minority status, and percent female are associated with worse outcomes following a natural disaster.  These sorts of disparities are often recognizable on the local level, but are often overlooked when mitigation funding is being considered.  The first large scale implementation of this concept was realized in 2011 by Flanagan et al after hurricane Katrina. It was used in the HAZUS-MH software provided by the Federal Emergency Management system to assess danger from floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes.  Fire has been notably absent from these plans, but that does not mean Social Vulnerablity has not played a roll in fire related affects.

## Methods

The objective of this project is to construct a measure of *fewer economic resources* for the WUI in Colorado.  The layer created is intended to highlight areas that are eligible for a reduced match via the Colorado State Forest service grants for wildfire risk mitigation.

## Introduction to Index

We adapt the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) (Flanagan et al., 2011) to the wildland fire context in Colorado.  The SVI was created in response to Hurricane Katrina.  The SVI ranges from 0 (not vulnerable) to 100 (highly vulnerable), and acknowledges that those who are socially vulnerable are more likely to experience loss and less likely to recover.  Its original intent was to help state and federal level disaster responders identify the most affected areas post-event.  The authors also recognize its potential for use in other stages of the disaster cycle, such as recovery.

The projects funded by FRWRM fall into the mitigation and preparedness portions of the disaster cycle, but many of the post-event considerations apply to mitigation and preparedness.  The SVI addresses four main categories of vulnerability: socioeconomic status, household composition/ disability, minority status/ language, and housing/transportation.  These characteristics are important during all phases of the disaster cycle, especially mitigation.  Those with little purchasing power, high burden of care, or who experience difficulty interacting with the community for cultural or physical reasons will be less able to participate in mitigation activity.  Communities who have high overall levels of vulnerability may require additional assistance to complete migitation activities.  

Average measures within a community may obscure the variation in vulnerability within the community.  For example, a census defined geography may contain households that qualify as highly vulnerable and households that qualify as minimally vulnerable.  Average characteristics reported in this community may indicate moderate vulnerability.  We account for these heterogeneities by adding two measures to the SVI: income GINI coefficient, and an education GINI coefficient.  The GINI coefficient is commonly used to measure inequality, another measure of heterogeneity. Using the example of income, if everyone had the same income, the income GINI would equal zero.  Conversely, if one household collected all of the income in a CBG and the rest of the community received none, the income GINI would equal one.  

We calculate the augmented SVI using the methodology in the original paper.  Lower augmented SVI scores indicate lower vulnerability with 0 being the least vulnerable.  The Index is bounded between 0 and 1.  First, we percent rank the variables independently accross all CBGs in the area of interest, in this case Colorado.  Second, we add the scores together and percent rank them again.  This percent rank is the augmented SVI score.  We make a few minor changes to the original index variables to reflect modern ideas on measures of central tendency as well as data limitations. 

## Data

The orginal SVI was based on data from the 1990 Census.  Here we have updated it to more closely reflect the Colorado communities we see today.  We construct the Colorado SVI using data from the 2016 American Community Survey (5-year average).  While the original SVI was calculated at the census tract, we calculate it at the census block group level (smaller geographic unit) to better identify community demographics.  We then crop the spatial layers to the boundary of the WUI as defined by the boundaries used in the grant process.. 

All data analysis and geoprocessing is conducted in R Statistical Computing Language.  All steps are documented and the code is made available on GitHub.

### Geographic exploration

When condsidering an index that will function well fro a specific issue and place there it is advantagous to adapt the general index to reflect its context.  In this project we are addressing wildfire preparedness in the WUI.  This means that urban areas and the concerns that arise from them are less important than they would be in a hurricane or a flood senario.  For this reason we have limited the scope of the comparitive analysis to only CBGs that contain WUI.  Additionally we are limiting the importance of some of the variables listed above that pertain to urban crowding. This importance ranking will be accomplished by assigning weights to the variables used above. These weights will bounded between (0,1). 

It is importnt not to try to gerrymander the weights in order to exclude certian areas from qualifying for additional assistance if they should not qualify due to their urban nature.  We have limited the extent of comparison to only CBGs that have WUI within them to reduce the affect of the urban area.  This resulted in a number of CBGs that previously did not qualify for the increased match do when urban areas are not considered.  No CBGs of interest lost status as a result of the cutting.

    overlayGroups = c("Augmented SVI"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))%>%
      hideGroup(c("Augmented SVI"))
map
```

Currently we are expirimenting with setting some of the housing/transportation variables down.  The map below shows how setting the weight on variable 11 to 0 changes the allocations of vulnerable and not vulnerable. When we change the weights on the variables there is a 1-1 relationship between qualification flips.  The reduction in number of CBGs made it possible to have unbalanced qualification changes.  As a result of this change we saw 53 CBGs flip qualifications.  I propose that we set the wieghts for 11 to be zero.  Other potential weight reductions could includegroup housing, crowding?, 


In considering if a variable needs weighting adjustment it is sometimes useful to consult variable summary statistics:
```{r stats}
SVI_layer%>%
  dplyr::select(poverty_percent_below_1:gini_education)%>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)%>%
  summary()

```
